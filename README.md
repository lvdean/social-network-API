## Description

The challenge this week was to build an API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friends’ thoughts, and create a friend list.

### User Story
As a social media startup I want an API for my social network that uses a NoSQL database so that my website can handle large amounts of unstructured data.

## Completed Issues

* Start server and sync the Mongoose models to the MongoDB database.
* Open API GET routes in Insomnia for users and thoughts.
* Data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON.
* Successfully create, update, and delete users and thoughts in my database.
* Successfully create and delete reactions to thoughts and add and remove friends to a user’s friend list.



## Installation

Clone the repo: git@github.com:lvdean/social-network-API.git

Next, use the terminal to run the command npm i to install the dependencies associated with this application.

To run the application, within the terminal, type the command npm start.
